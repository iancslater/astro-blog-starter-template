**Current events at the time** brought us a starter for this poster. Though we could have used a generic image to represent _parental denouncement_, we opted to portray the controversy.

Perhaps we're due for an update.

Retrieved from wayback machine in January 2026; upscaled, Victory arrow reapplied, and text retyped.

## Design notes and checklist

- Victory approval and Orwell stamp applied to blown-out news image
- Surrounding black for isolation
- Reminder that the telescreen is always there and you have a duty to report

## Inventory Control Notes

- Allow placement for proletariat awe and distraction.
- Monitor for defacement.
- Consider for PSA drive when denouncement numbers are low.
