## Codex guidance for this repo (STRICT)

### Astro documentation source of truth

For **any** question that involves Astro docs (APIs, config, routing, integrations, content collections, adapters, deployments, SSR, middleware, auth patterns, etc.), you **MUST** consult the MCP server named `astroDocs` ([https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp](https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp)) **before** answering or changing code.

**Rules:**

1. **No guessing / no “from memory”** on Astro behavior, options, defaults, or syntax.
2. If the MCP lookup **fails or is unavailable**, do **not** proceed. Say exactly what you couldn’t verify and ask me how to proceed.
3. When you use MCP, **cite the doc page/title** you relied on (or summarize the section you used) so I can verify quickly.
4. If multiple doc pages conflict, prefer the **most recently updated** page and tell me about the conflict.

### When not required

If the task is not Astro-related (e.g., pure JS utilities, internal business logic), proceed normally.
